Notes to self for troubleshooting

Connection problems
-If both the accelerometer and temp sensor aren't connecting
	-Check that the SCL/SDA pins being used are those with built-in pullup resistors (i.e. pins 20 and 21)
	-Make sure the SCL/SDA pins are plugged into the right ports
	-Make sure that the 5V and Ground pins are in the right spot (the accelerometer has a LED, check if its lit)
-If just the accelerometer isn't working
	-Make sure that the following pins are all in: 
		-Ground
		-5V (Or 3.3 I think...)
		-SCL
		-SDA
		-Interrupt (goes into pin 2, see .h def)
	-Make sure the setup function isn't commented out
-If just the temp sensor isn't working
	-Make sure that all of the following pins are in:
		-Ground
		-5V (Or 3.3 I think...)
		-SCL
		-SDA
	-Make sure the setup function isn't commented out

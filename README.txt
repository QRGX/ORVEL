This is the code for the Queen's Reduced Gravity Experiment Team (QRGX) for the 2017/2018 year.
This year is project ORVEL (Observation of Ring Vortex Evolution in Liquids).


NOTE:
-Base code for the MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope is based on the work of Jeff Rowberg (https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib)
-Base code for the BME280 Pressure/Temperature sensor based on code from SparkFun (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BME280_Arduino_Library)
-Base code for the PCA9685 PWM Servo Driver is based on the Adafuit library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library)
-The laptop code uses several libraries (as seen in ./LaptopSide/lib) 
	-Serial (http://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/)
	-JSON	(http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.json/json/20180130)
